           Extropy is the annual Chemical Engineering Symposium organised by the Department of Chemical Engineering, BITS Pilani. It aims to manifest the spirit of chemical engineering in young students in the field. A three-day extravaganza involving lectures, exhibitions, workshops and many fun-with-learning events, the purpose of Extropy includes besides nurturing the spirit of chemical engineering, showcasing the myriad world of Chemical Engineering and providing a boost to the core culture on campus. Past speakers comprise many eminent researchers, industrialists and entrepreneurs from Chemical Engineering and neighbouring fields. This year, in 2019, we strive to reach even newer heights while carrying on the mantle called ‘Extropy’ forward.
